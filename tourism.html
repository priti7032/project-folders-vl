        <h2>Tourism and Climate in Goa</h2>
        <p>Goa's climate plays a significant role in its tourism industry.</p>
        <p>The peak tourist season is during the cooler and drier months from November to February.</p>
        <p>The monsoon season (June to September) sees fewer tourists due to heavy rainfall, but it is a great time for nature lovers and those seeking a quieter experience.</p>
        <p>Many festivals and events are scheduled around the climate seasons to attract visitors.</p>

        <p>Tourism businesses adapt their offerings based on the climate, providing seasonal activities and experiences.</p>
